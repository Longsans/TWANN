# This Web App `Needs `a Name

Hi, and welcome to my web application frontend repo. This frontend was built using [React](https://reactjs.org/), along with a REST API backend, whose repo you can view [here](https://github.com/Longsans/aspdotnet-practice). It uses ASP.NET Core WebAPI to accommodate a few basic endpoints.

This project was built for practice during my internship at KMS Technology VN. There is room for improvements.

This application is not used for commercial purposes.
